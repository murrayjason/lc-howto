The **Frisbee** is Listening Club parlance for the ownership of the coming Sunday’s music pick. At the end of one of our Sunday sessions, the Frisbee holder tosses it another member. If that other member is you (congrats!) and you accept, here’s how to handle it:

1. Pick an album you want to play for everyone next Sunday. Use whichever criteria that strike your fancy, such as you love it and can’t wait to share it, or you’re curious what we’ll all tweet about it… the way you handle this step is entirely up to you. There is no correct or incorrect way, and pretty much anything goes. You can pick a studio album, a live album, a couple of EPs from a single artist or even from two related artists. We shy away from playing our own mixtapes or our own music, though. To make sure you aren’t repeating a previously-played album, check out `@akx`’s [handy list](https://github.com/akx/listeningclub/blob/master/entries.tsv) <br /><br />
2. Format the music into MP3 format (as high quality as you like) as one continuous file. Make sure you’ve stripped all identifying MP3 tags from the file so as not to give away its identity. If you’re not sure how to do these steps, ask @kleptones, @jimmaccauley, or @saucer for help. <br /><br />
3. Compress the music into a single .zip or .rar archive. Again, ask for help if you need it. <br /><br />
4. Write a little introduction to your pick. As in how you handle the music pick itself, pretty much anything goes for the intro. Have fun with this part. You could explan why you picked the music, or a little background or some references… but take care to avoid giving too much of the guessing game away. Some members include a #drinkingclub suggestion to accompany the pick. <br /><br />
5. Upload the archive and your introduction to a publicly-accessibly place. Be sure to do this by the Saturday evening prior to the Sunday that we play your pick. Options for upload location include Google Drive, DropBox, Box, and so on. Send @kleptones a link to that upload location. <br /><br />
6. Upload the archive again to an online listening portal. A good one to use is https://hearthis.at (MixCloud tends to identify known albums and delete them, so avoid MixCloud.) Again, send @kleptones a link to the upload location. <br /><br />
7. On Sunday when we’re all finished listening to your pick, reveal its details on Twitter, using the #listeningclub hash tag. You might want to @ the artist themselves in your tweet, or include links to a bio, discography, or the album itself. <br /><br />
8. Now you get to toss the frisbee to another member among those who participated. Base your pick on witticisms, antagonisms, months since they last held the frisbee, or whatever. It’s entirely up to you. <br /><br />
