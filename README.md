Greetings! We listen to a mystery album together on Twitter every Sunday at 8 pm GMT. [Join us](https://twitter.com/listeningclub) and search the `#listeningclub` hash tag for the action.

To get our weekly pick: Each Sunday, and sometime before we start, the Listening Club twitter account announces that the dayâ€™s music pick is ready to download. Download the pick from [our site](https://thelisteningclub.blogspot.com), and set it up in your music player, in time to play/listen along.
