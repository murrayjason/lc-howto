The **Frisbee** is Listening Club parlance for ownership of the coming Sunday‚Äôs music pick. At the end of one of our Sunday sessions, the Frisbee holder tosses it to another member. If that other member is you (üéâ&nbsp;congrats!&nbsp;üëè) and you accept, here‚Äôs how to handle it:

0. Pick an album you want to play for everyone next Sunday. Use whichever criteria that strike your fancy, such as you love it and can‚Äôt wait to share it, or you‚Äôre curious what we‚Äôll all tweet about it‚Ä¶ the way you handle this step is entirely up to you. There‚Äôs no correct or incorrect way, and pretty much anything goes. You can pick a studio album, a live album, a compilation (single artist or various artists), a couple of EPs (from one artist or two related artists). We shy away from playing our own mixtapes or our own music, though. To make sure you aren‚Äôt repeating a previously-played album, check out [`@akx`](https://twitter.com/akx)‚Äôs [handy list](https://github.com/akx/listeningclub/blob/master/entries.tsv). <br /><br />
0. Format the music into MP3 format (as high quality as you like) as one continuous file. Make sure you‚Äôve stripped all identifying MP3 tags from the file so as not to give away its identity. If you‚Äôre not sure how to do these steps, ask [`@kleptones`](https://twitter.com/kleptones), [`@jimmccauley`](https://twitter.com/JimMcCauley), or [`@saucer`](https://twitter.com/saucer) for help. <br /><br />
<!-- 3. Compress the music into a `.zip` or `.rar` archive. Again, ask for help if you need it. <br /><br /> -->
0. Write a little introduction to your pick, for us to post on [the blog](https://thelisteningclub.blogspot.com). Pretty much anything goes for the intro so have fun. You could explain why you picked the music, or a little background or some references‚Ä¶¬†but take care to avoid giving too much of the guessing game away. Toward the end of their intro, some members include a `#drinkingclub` suggestion to accompany the pick. <br /><br />
0. Upload the archive and your introduction to a publicly-accessible place. Be sure to do this by the Saturday evening prior to the Sunday that we play your pick. Options for upload location include Google Drive, DropBox, Box, and so on. Send a Twitter direct message (DM) to [`@kleptones`](https://twitter.com/kleptones) with a link to that upload location. <br /><br />
0. If you can, upload the MP3 file to an online listening portal. A good one to use is [HearThis](https://hearthis.at). (MixCloud tends to identify uploaded albums and delete them, so avoid MixCloud.) If you do this step, DM [`@kleptones`](https://twitter.com/kleptones) to let him know you did, and provide the link to the upload location. <br /><br />
0. On Sunday when we‚Äôre all finished listening to your pick, reveal its details on Twitter, using the `#listeningclub` hash tag. You might want to `‚Äú@‚Äù` the artist themselves in your big-reveal tweet, or include links to a bio, discography, or the album itself. <br /><br />
0. Now you get to toss the frisbee to another member among those who participated. Base your pick on witticisms, antagonisms, months since they last held the frisbee, or whatever. It‚Äôs up to you. <br /><br />

Job well done.
