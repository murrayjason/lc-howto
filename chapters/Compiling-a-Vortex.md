# Compiling a Vortex

Compiling a vortex means, first and foremost, nagging and coercing #listeningclub members to submit. Submit *tracks*, you weirdo. And second, it means assembling those tracks into a (possibly coherent) single MP3 file for playback on the final Sunday of the month.

It’s performative art. It’s project management. It’s attention to detail.

The starting point for a round of LC vortex is a musical theme for those submitted tracks. You inherit the theme that last month’s compiler prompted the LC masses to invent and agree on. Theme prompting becomes your job, before all’s said and done, in prep for the vortex after yours.

To see some past themes, check out <a href = "https://github.com/akx/listeningclub/blob/master/vortices.txt">the list</a>.

So, the steps here assume we’ve already settled on a theme for your vortex: submitters will aim (or not) to abide by it.

Roughly speaking, as you act as compiler for this month’s vortex you perform the following steps:

0. Determine logistics for submitting tracks
0. Pick a submission deadline
0. Announce and nag
0. Assemble the tracks into a single vortex file
0. Create a text file listing tracks and submitters
0. (Optional) Write an intro blurb
0. Provide the goodies to @Kleptones
0. Coordinate picking a compiler for next time.
0. Coordinate picking a theme for next time.
